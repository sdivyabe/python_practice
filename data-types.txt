Group of element represented using a single variables
    ->List
    ->tuple
    ->set
    ->Dictionary
    -these are the 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data

list
-----
    -Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
    -is an ordered and particular Sequence are followed
    -is indexed
    -it allow duplicates
    -

tuples
------
    -allow duplicate values
    -it is unchangeble object we cant add or remove element after tuple has created(we can convert tuple into list and add values)
    
set
----
    -is a collection of is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.
    -is do not allow duplicate values.
    -Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.
    -Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key. 
    -Set items are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created
